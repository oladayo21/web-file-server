# Web Standards Compliant File Server Implementation Plan

## Implementation Approach
**Collaborative Development**: This project will be implemented phase by phase, with user collaboration throughout the entire process. Each phase will be implemented completely and tested before moving to the next phase. The implementation will NOT provide all phases at once or the entire solution upfront.

## Research Summary

Based on analysis of existing solutions (sirv, Hono, Deno std/http/file-server, Node.js static servers), the following features are essential for a web standards compliant file server:

### Core Web Standards Requirements
- **HTTP Protocol Standards**: Request/Response objects, proper status codes, Content-Type detection
- **Caching & Performance**: ETag generation, Last-Modified headers, Cache-Control, conditional requests
- **Content Delivery**: Range requests, compression (Gzip/Brotli/Deflate), pre-compressed files
- **Security**: Path traversal protection, dotfiles handling, CORS support, security headers
- **File System**: Index file resolution, directory listings, custom root, path rewriting

### Competitive Analysis
| Feature | sirv | Hono | Deno std | Our Goal |
|---------|------|------|----------|----------|
| ETag Support | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Range Requests | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Compression | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Pre-compressed | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| CORS Headers | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Platform Agnostic | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |

## Phase-by-Phase Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core File Serving (Foundation)
**Goals**: Establish basic file serving with security
- Basic Request Handler with URL-to-file path resolution and security checks
- MIME Type Detection with comprehensive file extension mapping  
- Error Handling with proper HTTP status codes (404, 403, 500)
- Path Security with traversal protection and root directory containment
- **🛑 Stop and review with user before proceeding to Phase 2**

### Phase 2: HTTP Standards Compliance
**Goals**: Implement HTTP caching and validation standards
- ETag Generation using SHA-256 for cache validation
- Last-Modified Headers with proper timestamp handling
- Conditional Requests supporting If-None-Match and If-Modified-Since
- Range Requests with HTTP byte-range support (206 Partial Content)
- **🛑 Stop and review with user before proceeding to Phase 3**

### Phase 3: Performance Optimization
**Goals**: Add compression and advanced caching
- Compression Support (Gzip, Brotli, Deflate) with Accept-Encoding negotiation
- Pre-compressed Files serving (.gz/.br variants when available)
- Cache-Control Headers with configurable caching directives
- Content Negotiation with proper Accept-* header handling
- **🛑 Stop and review with user before proceeding to Phase 4**

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
**Goals**: Directory handling and cross-origin support
- Index File Resolution with configurable index files
- Directory Listings with optional browsing and security controls
- CORS Support with cross-origin resource sharing headers
- Dotfiles Handling with configurable access control
- **🛑 Stop and review with user before proceeding to Phase 5**

### Phase 5: Security Hardening
**Goals**: Complete security implementation
- Security Headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options)
- Custom Headers support for user-defined response headers
- Error Page Customization with configurable responses
- Access Logging with optional request logging capabilities
- **🛑 Final review and testing**

## Collaborative Process Rules

1. **Phase-by-Phase**: Each phase will be implemented completely before moving forward
2. **User Approval**: User approval and feedback required before advancing to next phase
3. **Regular Testing**: Testing and validation throughout each phase
4. **Incremental Commits**: Maintain commits for each completed feature
5. **Design Discussion**: Discuss design decisions and trade-offs at each step
6. **No Shortcuts**: Will not implement multiple phases simultaneously

## Implementation Strategy

- Build incrementally with comprehensive tests for each phase
- Maintain web standards compatibility throughout
- Ensure platform-agnostic design (Node.js, Deno, Bun, Cloudflare Workers)
- Follow TypeScript strict mode and modern ESM practices
- Benchmark against sirv and other solutions for performance validation
- Use existing `FileServerOptions` interface as foundation and extend as needed

## Current Status
- ✅ Project setup complete (TypeScript, Biome, Git)
- ✅ Implementation plan documented
- ✅ **Phase 1 Complete**: Core File Serving with streaming support
- ✅ **Phase 2 Complete**: HTTP Standards Compliance
- ✅ **Phase 3 Complete**: Performance Optimization
- 🔄 Ready to begin Phase 4: Advanced Features

### Phase 1 Achievements
- ✅ Production-ready path resolution using Node.js APIs
- ✅ **Memory-efficient streaming** (default) for serverless environments
- ✅ Configurable streaming vs buffered reading
- ✅ MIME type detection with comprehensive mapping
- ✅ Index file resolution (index.html)
- ✅ Dotfiles handling (allow/deny/ignore)
- ✅ Proper HTTP status codes and error handling
- ✅ Web Standards Request/Response interface
- ✅ Node.js, Bun, Lambda compatibility

### Phase 2 Achievements
- ✅ **ETag generation** using SHA-256 with configurable strong/weak ETags
- ✅ **Last-Modified headers** with proper timestamp handling
- ✅ **Conditional requests** (If-None-Match, If-Modified-Since) returning 304 Not Modified
- ✅ **HTTP Range requests** with 206 Partial Content support
- ✅ **Accept-Ranges: bytes** header for range request discovery
- ✅ **416 Range Not Satisfiable** for invalid ranges
- ✅ **Range-aware streaming** for memory-efficient partial content delivery
- ✅ Full HTTP caching compliance for optimal browser/CDN integration

### Phase 3 Achievements
- ✅ **Content negotiation** with Accept-Encoding header parsing and quality values
- ✅ **Pre-compressed file serving** (.gz, .br) with automatic fallback
- ✅ **Cache-Control headers** with pattern-based configuration
- ✅ **Compression priority** (Brotli > Gzip > Deflate) for optimal bandwidth
- ✅ **Zero-overhead compression** using pre-built files instead of real-time compression
- ✅ **Configurable compression** support (enable/disable specific algorithms)
- ✅ **Smart MIME type detection** using original file extension, not compressed version
